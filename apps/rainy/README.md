# Rainy

Rainy was born as a small discord bot, that handles only one problem, checking and renaming every user on join. But as for now, it's an exclusive administrative bot for Warcraft-related discord communities. It's main purpose is to sync moderation actions in-between discord communities. Bot is named after `Rainon` ❤️ `Janisse`. She was co-manager of [**Monk's Temple of Five Dawns**,](https://discord.com/invite/fYSNb5U) and he is founder of [**Sanctum of Light**](https://discord.com/invite/sanctumoflight) discord community for paladin players in World of Warcraft.

## Permissions Policy

Rainy needs no special intent & only `rename user` permission and the most top (literally) upper-bottom placed role above all others It doesn't need an `administrator` title or any other special permissions. But anyway, since the code is open-sourced you could give to the bot any permissions and make sure that it won't abuse it.

If bot doesn't rename the user and your server mentioned in rename list, mainly because lack of permissions.
